Midterm Description

For my midterm, I'd like to make an art generating tool, similar to the many Jackson Pollock insipred paint tools you find scattered all over the internet.
For example:

However, I'd like to use a theme which isn't too heavily influenced by Pollock, as I feel that it is a little overdone. I want to make a quirky, stress busting paint tool that lets people share their weird art pieces.

Here are some sketches I pulled from my digital sketchbook, which I hope to use as influences for the brushes.
